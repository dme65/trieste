.. py:class:: ModelConfig

   This class is a specification for building a
   :class:`~trieste.models.TrainableProbabilisticModel`. It is not meant to be used by itself,
   subclasses that implement the missing asbtract methods should be used instead. These abstract
   methods define a default optimizer and all models supported by a specific model type (e.g.
   Gaussian processes implementation). Note that subclasses should also be frozen dataclasses.

   .. py:attribute:: model
      :annotation: :tf.Module | TrainableProbabilisticModel

      The :class:`~trieste.models.TrainableProbabilisticModel`, or the model to wrap in one. 


   .. py:attribute:: model_args
      :annotation: :dict[str, Any]

      The keyword arguments to pass to the model wrapper. 


   .. py:attribute:: optimizer
      :annotation: :Any

      The optimizer with which to train the model (by minimizing its loss function). 


   .. py:attribute:: optimizer_args
      :annotation: :dict[str, Any]

      The keyword arguments to pass to the optimizer wrapper. 


   .. py:method:: supported_models(self) -> dict[Any, collections.abc.Callable[[Any, trieste.models.optimizer.Optimizer], trieste.models.interfaces.TrainableProbabilisticModel]]
      :abstractmethod:

      Defines all models supported by certain model type (e.g. Gaussian process implementation).
      This method has to be specified by a model type specific subclass.

      :return: A mapping of third-party model types to :class:`CustomTrainable` classes that wrap
          models of those types.


   .. py:method:: create_model_interface(self) -> trieste.models.interfaces.TrainableProbabilisticModel

      :return: A model built from this model configuration.



.. py:data:: ModelSpec
   

   Type alias for any type that can be used to fully specify a model. 


.. py:function:: create_model(config: ModelSpec) -> trieste.models.interfaces.TrainableProbabilisticModel

   :param config: A :class:`TrainableProbabilisticModel` or configuration of a model.
   :return: A :class:`~trieste.models.TrainableProbabilisticModel` build according to ``config``.


.. py:class:: ModelStack(model_with_event_size: tuple[TrainableProbabilisticModel, int], *models_with_event_sizes: tuple[TrainableProbabilisticModel, int])

   Bases: :py:obj:`TrainableProbabilisticModel`

   A :class:`ModelStack` is a wrapper around a number of :class:`TrainableProbabilisticModel`\ s.
   It combines the outputs of each model for predictions and sampling, and delegates training data
   to each model for updates and optimization.

   **Note:** Only supports vector outputs (i.e. with event shape [E]). Outputs for any two models
   are assumed independent. Each model may itself be single- or multi-output, and any one
   multi-output model may have dependence between its outputs. When we speak of *event size* in
   this class, we mean the output dimension for a given :class:`TrainableProbabilisticModel`,
   whether that is the :class:`ModelStack` itself, or one of the subsidiary
   :class:`TrainableProbabilisticModel`\ s within the :class:`ModelStack`. Of course, the event
   size for a :class:`ModelStack` will be the sum of the event sizes of each subsidiary model.

   The order of individual models specified at :meth:`__init__` determines the order of the
   :class:`ModelStack` output dimensions.

   :param model_with_event_size: The first model, and the size of its output events.
       **Note:** This is a separate parameter to ``models_with_event_sizes`` simply so that the
       method signature requires at least one model. It is not treated specially.
   :param \*models_with_event_sizes: The other models, and sizes of their output events.

   .. py:method:: predict(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]

      :param query_points: The points at which to make predictions, of shape [..., D].
      :return: The predictions from all the wrapped models, concatenated along the event axis in
          the same order as they appear in :meth:`__init__`. If the wrapped models have predictive
          distributions with event shapes [:math:`E_i`], the mean and variance will both have
          shape [..., :math:`\sum_i E_i`].


   .. py:method:: predict_joint(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]

      :param query_points: The points at which to make predictions, of shape [..., B, D].
      :return: The predictions from all the wrapped models, concatenated along the event axis in
          the same order as they appear in :meth:`__init__`. If the wrapped models have predictive
          distributions with event shapes [:math:`E_i`], the mean will have shape
          [..., B, :math:`\sum_i E_i`], and the covariance shape
          [..., :math:`\sum_i E_i`, B, B].


   .. py:method:: sample(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType, num_samples: int) -> trieste.types.TensorType

      :param query_points: The points at which to sample, with shape [..., N, D].
      :param num_samples: The number of samples at each point.
      :return: The samples from all the wrapped models, concatenated along the event axis. For
          wrapped models with predictive distributions with event shapes [:math:`E_i`], this has
          shape [..., S, N, :math:`\sum_i E_i`], where S is the number of samples.


   .. py:method:: predict_y(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]

      :param query_points: The points at which to make predictions, of shape [..., D].
      :return: The predictions from all the wrapped models, concatenated along the event axis in
          the same order as they appear in :meth:`__init__`. If the wrapped models have predictive
          distributions with event shapes [:math:`E_i`], the mean and variance will both have
          shape [..., :math:`\sum_i E_i`].
      :raise NotImplementedError: If any of the models don't implement predict_y.


   .. py:method:: update(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset) -> None

      Update all the wrapped models on their corresponding data. The data for each model is
      extracted by splitting the observations in ``dataset`` along the event axis according to the
      event sizes specified at :meth:`__init__`.

      :param dataset: The query points and observations for *all* the wrapped models.


   .. py:method:: optimize(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset) -> None

      Optimize all the wrapped models on their corresponding data. The data for each model is
      extracted by splitting the observations in ``dataset`` along the event axis according to the
      event sizes specified at :meth:`__init__`.

      :param dataset: The query points and observations for *all* the wrapped models.



.. py:class:: ProbabilisticModel

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`

   A probabilistic model.

   .. py:method:: predict(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]
      :abstractmethod:

      Return the mean and variance of the independent marginal distributions at each point in
      ``query_points``.

      This is essentially a convenience method for :meth:`predict_joint`, where non-event
      dimensions of ``query_points`` are all interpreted as broadcasting dimensions instead of
      batch dimensions, and the covariance is squeezed to remove redundant nesting.

      :param query_points: The points at which to make predictions, of shape [..., D].
      :return: The mean and variance of the independent marginal distributions at each point in
          ``query_points``. For a predictive distribution with event shape E, the mean and
          variance will both have shape [...] + E.


   .. py:method:: predict_joint(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]
      :abstractmethod:

      :param query_points: The points at which to make predictions, of shape [..., B, D].
      :return: The mean and covariance of the joint marginal distribution at each batch of points
          in ``query_points``. For a predictive distribution with event shape E, the mean will
          have shape [..., B] + E, and the covariance shape [...] + E + [B, B].


   .. py:method:: sample(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType, num_samples: int) -> trieste.types.TensorType
      :abstractmethod:

      Return ``num_samples`` samples from the independent marginal distributions at
      ``query_points``.

      :param query_points: The points at which to sample, with shape [..., N, D].
      :param num_samples: The number of samples at each point.
      :return: The samples. For a predictive distribution with event shape E, this has shape
          [..., S, N] + E, where S is the number of samples.


   .. py:method:: predict_y(self, query_points: trieste.types.TensorType) -> tuple[trieste.types.TensorType, trieste.types.TensorType]
      :abstractmethod:

      Return the mean and variance of the independent marginal distributions at each point in
      ``query_points`` for the observations, including noise contributions.

      Note that this is not supported by all models.

      :param query_points: The points at which to make predictions, of shape [..., D].
      :return: The mean and variance of the independent marginal distributions at each point in
          ``query_points``. For a predictive distribution with event shape E, the mean and
          variance will both have shape [...] + E.


   .. py:method:: get_observation_noise(self) -> trieste.types.TensorType
      :abstractmethod:

      Return the variance of observation noise.

      Note that this is not supported by all models.

      :return: The observation noise.


   .. py:method:: get_kernel(self) -> gpflow.kernels.Kernel
      :abstractmethod:

      Return the kernel of the model.
      :return: The kernel.



.. py:class:: TrainableProbabilisticModel

   Bases: :py:obj:`ProbabilisticModel`

   A trainable probabilistic model.

   .. py:method:: update(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset) -> None
      :abstractmethod:

      Update the model given the specified ``dataset``. Does not train the model.

      :param dataset: The data with which to update the model.


   .. py:method:: optimize(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset) -> None
      :abstractmethod:

      Optimize the model objective with respect to (hyper)parameters given the specified
      ``dataset``.

      :param dataset: The data with which to train the model.
